# Sparks Foundation Internship Task
## _Prediction using Supervised ML_
### Submitted By: _B Zahid Hussain_
## **Linear Regression with Python Tensorflow and keras**
In this, we will see how the Python Tensorflow library for machine learning can be used to implement the given task 1.

### **Task details**
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.


## Tech


- [Python] - Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.
- [Tensorflow] - TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning.
- [Numpy] - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.
- [Matplotlib] - Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
- [Keras] - Keras is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library.
